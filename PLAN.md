## Phase 1: Python Launch Scripts
- Convert your launching infrastructure to Python (keeping `script.slurm` as the SLURM interface)
- Build on your existing prototype code

## Phase 2: Sliding Window Integration
- Integrate sliding window attention into the full BRIDGE architecture
- Implement sliding cross-attention mechanisms
- Conduct memory studies across encoding, decoding, and mixing layers

## Phase 3: Multi-Layer Encoder + Nemo Integration
- Develop simple n-block encoder architecture
- Integrate with Nemo framework
- Implement multi-GPU parallelization strategies for your 2-GPU setup

## Phase 4: Dataset Integration
- Download and integrate Wiki-103 dataset
- Adapt BRIDGE to work with this larger-scale dataset

This progression makes sense - you're moving from infrastructure improvements to architectural enhancements to scaling and real-world dataset integration. The sliding window attention work will be particularly interesting for memory efficiency, and the multi-GPU experimentation will help you understand the trade-offs between different parallelization approaches.

I'm ready to help when you're ready to start with Phase 1 (the Python launch scripts). Just let me know when you'd like to begin!
